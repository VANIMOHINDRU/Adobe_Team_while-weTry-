# PDF Insight Extractor

This project extracts key insights from PDF documents by analyzing section headings and corresponding content based on a given persona and job-to-be-done. It is designed to assist downstream systems like LLMs or recommender engines in consuming structured outputs.

---

## Overview

Given:
- A set of PDFs
- A user persona (JSON)
- A job-to-be-done (text)

The system:
1. Extracts document metadata
2. Identifies relevant headings and sections
3. Analyzes sub-sections to refine useful content
4. Outputs structured JSON containing all results

##  Methodology

### 1. Metadata Extraction

The pipeline begins by:
- Collecting all PDF names
- Parsing the persona JSON (e.g., role, field)
- Reading job-to-be-done text
- Adding a processing timestamp

This provides contextual metadata needed for downstream filtering.

### 2. Section Extraction

Uses PyMuPDF to:
- Parse text blocks per page
- Identify headings based on font size, style (bold/caps), and layout
- Merge multi-line headings if they share font size and are visually continuous
- Store heading positions for extracting nearby content

### 3. Sub-section Analysis

- Locates text under each heading (up to 2â€“3 pages ahead)
- Extracts only content until the next heading
- Filters based on relevance to the persona and job
- Adds refined text to the output

### 4. Output Structuring

Final output is saved in JSON format with three sections:
- metadata
- extracted_sections
- sub_section_analysis

##  Running Locally via Docker

### Step 1: Build Docker Image

Ensure you're in the root directory of the project:

```bash
docker build -t pdf-analyser .
```

## Step 2: Run the Container

```bash 
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app pdf-analyser

```
This mounts your local folder to the Docker container and runs the analysis. The output will be written to:

```bash
outputs/output.json

```
The JSON contains three top-level keys:

1. metadata  
   General information about the input documents and task context.

2. extracted_sections  
   Key headings and content segments from the PDF relevant to the persona and job.

3. sub_section_analysis  
   Further-refined and filtered sub-sections with contextually important text for the user.
